## Humanitarian Aid - Buriram

The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina assisted an elderly woman suffering from severe rheumatism and her disabled daughter living in extreme poverty near Buriram, Thailand.

### Initial Support

The initial support of **100,000 baht** (approximately €2,500) enabled:
- House reconstruction with toilet, electricity, and running water
- Supply of a refrigerator, mattresses, mosquito nets, and fans

### Ongoing Aid

A monthly stipend of **3,000 baht** (approximately €75) was established for food and daily necessities.

"Every cent donated is used for the project in question; our club retains nothing for operating costs."
