## Chakrit's Story

The story of Chakrit, an 11-year-old student discovered during YWCA visits to Huay Yai school, touched the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina. The child bore a severe disfiguring scar on his right ear from burn injuries sustained years earlier.

### An Abandoned Child

Abandoned at birth, Chakrit was raised by an elderly couple (over 70 years old) who collected trash, living in a deteriorating shelter.

### Medical Intervention

Dr. Olivier secured pro bono plastic surgery from Dr. Narong Nimsakul, a renowned Bangkok surgeon. The operation was performed in mid-March 2007. The club provided logistics and transportation to Bangkok.

### A New Beginning

On June 24, 2007, the club built a permanent house for Chakrit and his adoptive parents, along with long-term educational sponsorship and daily financial assistance.
