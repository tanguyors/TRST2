## First Aid Kits for Schools

On August 11, 2009, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina coordinated the renewal of 11 first aid kits donated by Bangkok-Pattaya Hospital, distributed to two schools in Pattaya.

### Impact

This "First Aid Cabinet" project ensures schools have up-to-date and operational first aid equipment for the safety of students and teaching staff.
