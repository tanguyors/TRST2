## Art Therapy Evening

On April 30, 2022, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina organized an evening at the Royal Cliff Hotel in Pattaya featuring a conference by Constance Decharme on art therapy.

### Art Therapy

Art therapy is a psychological support approach based on self-expression through image creation. "Painting with hands allows emotions to be externalized and energy to be restored."

### Results

The evening raised **40,000 baht** for the club's charitable activities, in particular to fund Pim's eye operation.
