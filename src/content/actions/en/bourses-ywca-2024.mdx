## Scholarships and Vision 20/20

In partnership with the YWCA, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina sponsors scholarships and vision programs for underprivileged schoolchildren in and around Pattaya.

### The Vision 20/20 Program

This program aims to screen and correct vision problems among school-age children, which are often a major barrier to learning.

### The Scholarships

Scholarships are awarded to students from various schools in the presence of the Mayor of Pattaya and YWCA representatives, enabling young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to continue their education.

### Impact

- Vision screening for hundreds of schoolchildren
- Awarding of scholarships
- Long-standing partnership with the YWCA
