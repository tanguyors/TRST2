## Student Scholarships - YWCA

The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina distributes scholarships to students from various schools in the presence of the Mayor of Pattaya and representatives of the YWCA (Young Women Christian Association).

### An Annual Program

For the 2012-2013 year, the club distributed **15 scholarships** through YWCA to support education for disadvantaged children. This initiative has been renewed annually since 2005.

### Impact

The scholarships help the most disadvantaged families cover essential school expenses: uniforms, shoes, and school supplies.
