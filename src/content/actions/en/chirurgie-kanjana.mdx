## Kanjana's Surgical Operation

The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina funded the surgery for young Kanjana, suffering from a facial deformity, at Bangkok Hospital in May 2010, just before the start of the school year.

### Impact

This operation allowed Kanjana to regain a normal life and return to school with confidence.

"Every cent donated is used for the project in question; our club retains nothing for operating costs."
