## Warm Clothing and Blankets for Karen Children

As part of the 2017-2018 initiative to help Karen communities in mountainous regions, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina organized a collection of warm clothes, blankets, books, and toys for children in Huei Kra Ting village.

### Distribution

The village has 183 households and 524 residents. Donations were transported on January 20 to Mae Sot for distribution, complementing the water supply project.

"Every cent donated is used for the project in question; our club retains nothing for operating costs."
