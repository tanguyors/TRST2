## Hua Yai School

Hua Yai School is located 10 km from Pattaya. Its 180 students are spread across kindergarten through 6th grade. **80% of the students come from underprivileged backgrounds.**

### Our Action

The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina provided material support to this school, helping to improve learning conditions for the students.

### First Aid Cabinets

In August 2009, Bangkok Hospital Pattaya donated 11 first aid kits to the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina, intended for schools in the region including Hua Yai School.

### Impact

These actions enable children from disadvantaged backgrounds to benefit from better learning conditions and access to first aid care right within their school.
