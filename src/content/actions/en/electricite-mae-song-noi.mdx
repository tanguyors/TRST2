## Solar Electricity - Mae Song Noi

The isolated Mae Song Noi village, home to 70 Karen families in northwest Thailand, received solar panels and batteries from the Thai government in 2004.

### The Project

As batteries deteriorated, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina partnered with the Rotary Club Erasme of Brussels to replace them. The project aimed to replace 25 failing solar batteries with modern 12V/135Ah units, estimated at **151,000 baht**, including transport, installation, and recycling of old batteries.

### Impact

This replacement enables children to study and families to charge communication devices after dark.
