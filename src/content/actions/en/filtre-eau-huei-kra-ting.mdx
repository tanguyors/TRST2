## Water Filters - Huei Kra Ting

The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina's main project for 2017-2018 focused on supporting Karen communities in the mountainous Mae Sot region.

### The Village

Huei Kra Ting village, located approximately 70 km north of Mae Sot (2 hours by road), has 183 houses and 524 inhabitants (261 men, 263 women), with 65 kindergarten and primary students taught by 4 teachers.

Residents live mainly from rice farming (60%), corn (20%), and livestock (20%). The population is approximately 90% Christian and 10% Buddhist.

### The Filtration System

Water becomes turbid during the rainy season. The installed system produces approximately **300 liters of drinking water daily** through gravel, biologically active sand, and charcoal filters. Water is stored in four 200-liter tanks, each weighing under 10 kg for foot transport through remote areas.

### Budget and Partners

Budget: approximately **€2,700** (100,000 baht). Partners: Rotary E-Club District 9220 (Réunion), Bacchus Bourbon, Tak Border Child Assistance.
