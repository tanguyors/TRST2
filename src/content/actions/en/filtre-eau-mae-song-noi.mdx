## Water Filters - Mae Song Noi

Mae Song Noi village (70 families, 563 inhabitants) is located in the Karen mountains, near the Burma-Thailand border.

### Context

The Karen people, originally from Tibet, live in near self-sufficiency (rice cultivation, livestock). The village is accessible only via difficult mountain roads, taking several hours by 4x4. Residents traditionally had no access to treated drinking water.

### The Project

The Thai government recently installed water filters for school and teacher needs. The Rotary project provided **1,000-liter** storage tanks with three-stage filtration systems for the entire community.

"For the first time in their lives, the inhabitants of this village will be able to drink clean water!"
