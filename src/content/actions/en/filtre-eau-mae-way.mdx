## Water Filters - Mae Way

The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina equipped the Karen village of Mae Way with a drinking water distribution system featuring filtration and purification.

### The Village

Mae Way has 56 households and 330 residents, including 94 school-age children taught by 10 teachers. The village is located 183 km from Mae Sot, requiring 4 hours by vehicle in dry season.

### The System

The system produces approximately **300 liters of drinking water daily** through gravel, biologically active sand, and charcoal filters, stored in four 200-liter tanks. 8 filtration centers serve 3 to 5 families each.

### Impact

Water contamination caused intestinal problems and various illnesses. The project was funded through club activities with participation from the Rotary Club de Niort.
