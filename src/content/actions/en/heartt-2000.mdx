## Heartt 2000 Foundation

The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina has supported the Heartt 2000 Foundation of Dr. Philippe Seur for many years, an organization committed to fighting HIV/AIDS in Thailand.

### 2018 Charity Evening

On December 1, 2018, on World AIDS Day, our club organized a charity evening in support of the foundation. **70,000 baht** were presented during the ceremony on December 7, 2018.

### A Long-Standing Partnership

The club also organized a lecture by Dr. Philippe Seur in 2014, followed by a donation to the foundation, reflecting a lasting commitment to fighting this disease.

### Impact
