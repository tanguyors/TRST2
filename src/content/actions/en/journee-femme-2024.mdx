## International Women's Day 2024

On the occasion of International Women's Day, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina organized a solidarity outreach for female inmates at Pattaya Special Prison.

### Our Action

**20,000 baht** were allocated by the club for this initiative, enabling the distribution of essential items to the inmates.

This action is part of our ongoing commitment to women's rights and human dignity, following a similar initiative in 2023 carried out in partnership with the Rotary Sattahip and the Provincial Lawyers' Council.

### Impact

- Distribution of essential everyday items
- Moral and human support for the inmates
- Raising awareness about the conditions of incarcerated women
