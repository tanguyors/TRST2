## Purchase of PAPR Masks

On August 20, 2021, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina decided to participate in District 3340's initiative to acquire protective PAPR masks for healthcare workers.

### The PAPR Mask

PAPR is a fan-shaped antimicrobial mask with air filter, a motorized air-purifying respirator resulting from collaboration between medical and engineering faculties. These devices provide positive internal pressure meeting international standards and protect medical staff from COVID-19 and respiratory diseases.

### Delivery

The district ordered 61 units at 13,000 baht each. On September 8, 2021, Rotary Pattaya Marina and Rotary Jomtien-Pattaya presented these masks to public health officials at Banglamung Hospital.
