## Medical Mattress Distribution

On March 5, 2021, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina participated in the distribution of pneumatic medical mattresses for people in need.

### Our Contribution

Each mattress, valued at **2,000 baht**, provides essential comfort for bedridden patients. The club contributed to the purchase of six mattresses as part of this humanitarian initiative.

This action is part of the club's ongoing commitment to improving the living conditions of vulnerable people in the Pattaya region.
