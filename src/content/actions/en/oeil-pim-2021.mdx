## Pim's Eye Surgery

Pim, a 10-year-old orphan living with her ill grandmother, suffered from a drooping eyelid preventing vision in her right eye. The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina coordinated comprehensive medical intervention.

### Diagnosis and Treatment

The diagnosis revealed oculomotor nerve paralysis. Free surgery was arranged at Mettapracharak University Hospital (Nakhon Pathom Province) in October 2021.

The club also secured a YMCA scholarship for her school expenses and provided her with glasses and clothing.

### A Smile Restored

"At first, we met a girl who rarely smiled... Now she is beginning to smile more, and her smiles confirm that we are doing the right thing: serving the community."

### Impact

- Free eye surgery at the university hospital
- YMCA school scholarship secured
- Glasses and clothing provided
- Total cost: **28,000 baht**, fully covered by the club
