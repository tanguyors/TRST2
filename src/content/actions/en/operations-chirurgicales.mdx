## Surgical Operations for Children

The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina has funded several surgical operations for underprivileged children in the region.

### Pim's Eye (2020-2021)

Pim, a 10-year-old girl encountered during a food distribution event, suffered from a serious vision problem. The club funded her operation in Bangkok to save her eyesight.

### Operation Kanjana (May 2010)

Little Kanjana underwent surgery at Bangkok Hospital in May 2010, just before the start of the school year, to restore a normal appearance to her face.

### Child Chakrit

Chakrit bore a disfiguring scar on his right ear as well as scars on his right arm and right cheek. The club funded his surgical care.

### Our Commitment

These actions reflect our determination to make a real difference in the lives of children facing medical distress, by giving them access to specialized care they could never have afforded on their own.
