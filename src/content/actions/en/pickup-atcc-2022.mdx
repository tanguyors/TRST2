## Pick-up Truck for the ATCC

On October 30, 2022, an ISUZU pick-up truck was purchased and delivered to the ATCC (Anti-Human and Child Abuse Center) in Pattaya.

### A Collective Effort

This major project was made possible through the coordination of **7 Rotary clubs** and the **Pattaya Sport Club**. The Rotary Club Pattaya Marina played a key role in coordinating and funding this acquisition.

### The ATCC

The Anti-Human and Child Abuse Center is an essential child protection facility in Pattaya. This vehicle enables the ATCC teams to travel more efficiently for their field operations.

### Recognized Commitment

In July 2022, Mr. Thierry Mathou, Ambassador of France to Thailand, visited Pattaya to tour the ATCC, underscoring the importance of this institution and the support provided by our club.
