## Charity Evening - December 1, 2018

On December 1, 2018, the Rotary Club Pattaya Marina organized a charity evening at the Casa Pascal restaurant benefiting Dr. Philippe Seur's Heartt 2000 association.

### Ongoing Commitment

Dr. Seur received a donation of **70,000 baht** on December 7, 2018. Since arriving in Pattaya in 1998, Dr. Seur has assisted 2,785 patients. He currently treats approximately 600 HIV-positive patients, all receiving free care.

### The Financial Challenge

The foundation's monthly operational costs amount to approximately €32,000 (1,200,000 baht), funded primarily through donations. About 50 people attended the evening.

The club continues its support of Dr. Seur's work, while acknowledging that resources remain insufficient given the scale of needs.
