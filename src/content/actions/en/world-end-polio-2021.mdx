## World End Polio 2021

On October 24, 2021, three Rotary clubs (Jomtien-Pattaya, E'Dolphin Pattaya International, and Pattaya Marina) organized a grand evening at the Royal Cliff Grand Hotel for World Polio Day.

### An Exceptional Evening

The evening featured a fashion show, a lottery with numerous prizes, sales of T-shirts, mugs and pins, plus a band with lively rhythms in a warm atmosphere.

PDG Peter Malhotra served as master of ceremonies. Dr. Olivier, Club President, presented the event. PRIVP Mike McGovern, Vice President of Rotary International, spoke via Zoom. Two wheelchair-bound polio survivors also shared their testimonies.

### Results

All proceeds from this event were donated to Rotary for the fight against polio, amounting to **130,000 baht**.

Two members, Daniel and Dr. Michel, received the prestigious Paul Harris Fellow award.
